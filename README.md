## What is TRIP?

A structured development workflow for AI coding agents that brings **memory**, **consistency**, and **reduced hallucination** (only humans should) to AI-assisted development. TRIP helps you enter flow state and eat features like buttered noodles.
It is also the acronym (reversed) of the historical 4-phases development cycle: **P**lan, **I**mplement, **R**eview, **T**est.  
**Note:** Since v2.0.0 the flow is even simpler **Plan → Implement → Release** — review and test moved *inside* Implement as a testing gate and an automatic Codex review loop, every feature passes through all 4 phases with fewer commands.

TRIP was initially designed for Claude Code using the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) open standard (`SKILL.md`). Also compatible with OpenCode, Codex CLI, Mistral Vibe and more.

## Why TRIP?

There are tons of AI coding workflows out there like [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), [BMAD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD), [Gastown](https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown) and countless others. They might be powerful, but overwhelming for many of us dumb asses.

Even the "simple" ones come with:

- 47 different commands & skills to memorize
- Sub-agents swarm for God-knows-what
- Multi-chapters courses (sometimes paid lol)

**TRIP is different.** It's deliberately minimal:

| That's it           | Just these                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/TRIP-1-plan`      | Think before you code         |
| `/TRIP-2-implement` | Implement, test & review |
| `/TRIP-3-release`   | Version, changelogs, docs, commit, tag, merge, push    |

3 numbered skills. 1 architecture file. 0 PhD required.

The onboarding is: copy the folder, run init, start coding. If you can count to 3, you can TRIP.

It was kept stupid simple because **the goal is to ship features, not to master a workflow**. The workflow should disappear into the background, not become a project of its own.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the `skills/` folder contents to your repo's `.claude/skills/` or whatever
2. Run `/TRIP-init [YourProjectName]`
3. Follow the interactive prompts
4. Review and approve the generated ARCHI.md

### Additional For Mistral users (if they exist)

Also copy `AskUserQuestion/` to your agent `/skills/`, it provides the `AskUserQuestion` hook that TRIP workflow rely on.  

Et voila ! Start using the skills like `/TRIP-1-plan auth for this webapp`, `/TRIP-2-implement @auth-plan.md`, etc.

## The Heart of TRIP: ARCHI.md

The `ARCHI.md` file is the **central nervous system** of this workflow. It serves as the AI agent's **long-term memory** of your codebase.

### Why ARCHI.md Matters

**1. Persistent Context Across Sessions**

AI agents have no memory between sessions. Every new conversation starts from zero. ARCHI.md solves this by providing a comprehensive, always-up-to-date snapshot of your architecture that the agent reads at the start of each task. Unlike tool-specific files like `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, ARCHI.md is purely about architecture. It's tool-agnostic, so it works with any agent. You can still reference it from your `CLAUDE.md` to include it in all conversations.

**2. Token Savings & Reduced Hallucination**

Without ARCHI.md, your agent must glob, grep, and read multiple files to piece together the architecture from scratch for every single session. This wastes tokens and leads to guessing: _"There's probably a utils folder..."_, _"This project likely uses Redux..."_. ARCHI.md eliminates both problems. The agent gets the full picture in one read for minimal exploration & hallucination.

**3. Balanced Detail vs Token Usage**

ARCHI.md is designed to be:

- **Detailed enough** to provide meaningful context, **concise enough** to not waste tokens
- **Structured** for quick navigation
- **Updated** after every architectural change

It's not a dump of your entire codebase, rather a curated architectural guide.

## The Init Process

The `TRIP-init` skill is a **script written in human language** that programmatically bootstraps the TRIP workflow in any repository.

### What Init Does

1. **Creates the docs structure** - Folders for plans, changelogs, reviews, tests, memos
2. **Explores your codebase** - Identifies languages, frameworks, patterns, conventions
3. **Classifies your project** - Web frontend? CLI tool? Embedded firmware? Library?
4. **Generates ARCHI.md** - Tailored to your specific project type
5. **Customizes the skills** - Replaces placeholders with your project's specifics

### The Placeholder System

The generic TRIP skills contain placeholders like:

- `[PROJECT_NAME]` - Your project's name
- `[VERSION_FILE]` - Where your version is stored (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- `[ADAPT_TO_PROJECT: ...]` - Sections to customize

Init walks you through questions and replaces these placeholders based on your answers, creating a workflow tailored to your project.

## More Skills

### `/TRIP-status`

"Where was I?" in one command. Reconstructs the current state (phase, batch, last safe checkpoint) from git, plan files, and Codex threads, then gives you **exactly one next action**. Backed by a 5-line `docs/NOW.md` breadcrumb that every TRIP skill keeps current at phase transitions. Built for interrupted sessions, context-switching brains, and Monday mornings — re-entry costs seconds, not a scroll through history.

### `/codex-implement`

Implementation delegated to Codex CLI in a workspace-write sandbox.

### `/codex-plan-review` & `/codex-code-review`

Iterative review loops powered by Codex CLI.

### `/codex-ask`

A grounded second opinion on **anything**. TRIP-research uses it to brainstorm findings before presenting them.

### `/TRIP-review` & `/TRIP-test`

The former steps 3 and 4, reborn as on-demand support skills.

### `/TRIP-upgrade`

Upgrades an existing project's TRIP skills to a newer version without losing project customizations. Copy the new skills to `new-TRIP/`, run the skill, done.

### `/TRIP-hotfix`

Streamlined workflow for production emergencies. Bypasses full TRIP for genuine crises (or lazy debugging).

### `/TRIP-research`

Exploratory investigation with defined compute level. For feasibility studies and technology evaluation. Produces documented findings, not production code.

### `/TRIP-compact`

Run this skill to compact ARCHI.md size while preserving relevance, accuracy, and coverage through summarization and restructuring. Token calculator script included.

## Multi-Agent: Using Different LLMs at Different Steps

![TRIP Workflow multiLLM](assets/trip-workflow-multiLLM4.png)

Just like you wouldn't smell your own fart, an LLM is unlikely to catch bugs in its own implementation. Some people conduct adversarial review with a different session but still the same model, which is..._meh_. The best approach is to introduce a different model in the same reasoning ballpark as the first one, that will most likely catch what the other missed.

As of v2.0.0, this multi-agent approach is **the default workflow**.  
Considering Claude as your main and Codex as the copilot:  
Fable writes the plan, 5.6 Sol reviews it, Luna implements, back to Fable who reviews and fixes the diff, runs the testing gate, then a new Sol thread reviews again the code. All in one claude code session. Writer and reviewer are never the same thread.

```

As of mid july 2026, this Fable + GPT5.6 harness combo is absolute peak.

### Pay for the Top, Not for Everything

Frontier models won't stay cheap-to-free forever, and most checkboxes in a plan don't need one anyway. TRIP tiers the compute on **both** sides:

- Every plan to-do carries an `[S]`/`[M]`/`[C]` complexity marker (simple / standard / complex), assigned during `TRIP-1-plan`.
- The **orchestrator** (Fable) spends frontier tokens only on judgment: planning, batch sizing, delta reviews, fixes. It never types boilerplate.
- **Claude side**: batches delegated to subagents — Sonnet for `[S]`/`[M]` work, Opus for `[C]` — when running the Claude-only route.
- **Codex side**: the orchestrator exports `CODEX_TIER` per batch; `simple` drops to a light model at medium effort, `standard` runs Luna at high, `complex` gets Sol/Luna at xhigh. One env var (`CODEX_MODEL_LIGHT`) names your cheap model of choice.
- Reviews never tier below `standard` — the last line of defense is not where you save money.

Net effect: the expensive brains architect and audit; the affordable ones type. Your bill scales with how hard the work actually is, not with how many lines got written.

## Running Multiple Projects

Got several things cooking? See [PROJECTS-SETUP.md](PROJECTS-SETUP.md) for the recommended `~/Projects` folder layout — one subfolder per project, Claude Code and Codex both operating across all of them, a one-glance dashboard, and an ideas inbox so shiny new thoughts stop hijacking the current feature.

## MCP Servers: Less Is More

Last piece of advise before your new coding quest: Every MCP server you add is extra context, extra latency, and extra confusion. Keep it minimal. The one use case where MCP genuinely shines is **up-to-date documentation**, so your agent stops hallucinating deprecated APIs/whatever. Two servers cover it: [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) for current library & framework docs, and [Exa](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server) for web search when the answer isn't in any doc. No bloat beyond that.
